Adjusting Processing Speed

You can increase the processing speed by changing the number of workers. The relevant line of code is located at line 81 of server.js:
javascript

Copy code
const maxWorkers = 4; 

//Adjust this number to change the number of concurrent workers

Number should not be more than the number of your CPU cores

Model Settings

The Whisper model used is set to base for transcription. You can change this to a different model (e.g., small, medium, large) in transcriber.py if you want more accurate results, but keep in mind that using larger models may increase processing time.


Performance Tips

Adjusting the maxWorkers setting allows for parallel processing of multiple files. Increasing this value can lead to faster transcription but may require more system resources.
Experiment with different Whisper models to find a balance between accuracy and processing speed.
