Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file that you can use for your GitHub repository. It includes details about the project, how to increase processing speed by changing the number of workers, and information about the model configuration.

# Audio Transcriber

This project is an MP3 audio transcription service that utilizes a combination of Node.js and Python's Whisper model to convert audio files into text. The service allows users to upload multiple MP3 files and receive transcriptions in real-time.

## Features
- Upload multiple MP3 files for transcription.
- Real-time updates on transcription status.
- Supports customization for processing speed and model settings.

## Requirements
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- Python (v3.6 or higher)
- Whisper library (install using `pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Namaloom911/AudioTranscript.git
   cd AudioTranscript
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python and Whisper installed as mentioned in the Requirements section.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
- Upload your MP3 files for transcription.

## Configuration
### Adjusting Processing Speed
You can increase the processing speed by changing the number of workers. The relevant line of code is located at **line 81** of `server.js`:

```javascript
const maxWorkers = 4; // Adjust this number to change the number of concurrent workers
```

### Model Settings
The Whisper model used is set to **base** for transcription. You can change this to a different model (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) in `transcriber.py` if you want more accurate results, but keep in mind that using larger models may increase processing time.

## Performance Tips
- Adjusting the `maxWorkers` setting allows for parallel processing of multiple files. Increasing this value can lead to faster transcription but may require more system resources.
- Experiment with different Whisper models to find a balance between accuracy and processing speed.
